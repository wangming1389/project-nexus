For example: you can map your sub-domain: **login.abcmedia.com** so that your users can log in and use the portal from **login.abcmedia.com** and use the app like the screenshot below.

## Map CNAME Alias for Domain / Sub-Domain

In your Domain DNS management, map your desired domain/sub-domain to your OptiSigns sub-domain using CNAME Alias.  
In this example, we map: login.abcmedia.com -> abcmedia.optisigns.net

Refer to your domain host documentation for more specific details.

Here are the generic steps:

1. Go to your domain’s DNS records.
2. Add a record to your DNS settings, selecting **CNAME** as the record type.
3. Return to the first window or tab and copy the contents of the **Label/Host** field.
4. Paste the copied contents into the **Label** or **Host** field with your DNS records.
5. Return to the first window or tab and copy the contents of the **Destination/Target** field.
6. Paste the copied contents into the **Destination** or **Target** field with your DNS records.

   Your record should look similar to one of the tables below:

   **CNAME Record**

   | Record type | Label/Host field | Time To Live (TTL) | Destination/Target field |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | CNAME | login | 3600 or leave the default | abcmedia.optisigns.net |
7. Save your record.  
   CNAME record changes can take up to 72 hours to go into effect, but typically they happen much sooner.

## Activate SSL for Domain / Sub-Domain and Activating Add-On

Next, to activate your domain, you'll need to activate your Custom Domain add-on. This can be done either on the **Subscription Page** or directly from the **Branding Page**.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53467717890195)![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53467701210771)

The price is a flat **$10/month**, and there's a 14-day free trial for this feature as well.

Either way, once the Add-On is active, you can enter the domain/sub-domain you have configured in Step 2 in Your domain section.

In this example, we use: login.abcmedia.com

Then click Activate.

This will trigger the process on OptiSigns side to activate SSL for your sub-domain. This will ensure that your user can use HTTPS: i.e. <https://login.abcmedia.com> to use the app.

This process can take up to 24-48 hours to complete. You will be notified via email once it's done.

#### **That's all!**

Once you get the notification that your SSL is activated, you can start using your own domain/sub-domain (i.e. <https://login.abcmedia.com>).
