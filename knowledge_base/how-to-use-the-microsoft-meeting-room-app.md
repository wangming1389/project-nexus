## Creating a Microsoft Meeting Rooms App

To display Microsoft Meeting Rooms onscreen, you'll need to create an app within OptiSigns.

First, go to the [OptiSigns Portal](http://app.optisigns.com/). Go to **Files/Assets → Add Asset → Apps.**

Select **Microsoft Meeting Room**.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/50258994645651)

Here, you have two options. If you have used a Microsoft account on the OptiSigns platform, you can select it from the dropdown. If you have not, you'll need to hit **Login with Work Account**, enter in your Microsoft account information, and grant OptiSigns the necessary permissions. Then, hit **Next** within OptiSigns.

#### Theme Settings

| **NOTE** |
| Be sure to push the app to the intended screen first to test it - the Preview sometimes looks odd. |

You can also deploy it as part of a split screen, allowing you to show other assets at the same time. See how in our [Split Screen app article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573-How-to-Create-and-Use-the-Split-Screen-App) It can also be displayed in a Playlist or Schedule.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why does using Meeting Room require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.

### **That's all!**
