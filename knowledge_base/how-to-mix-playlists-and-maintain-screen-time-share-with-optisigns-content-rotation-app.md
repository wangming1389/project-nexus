* Enforce each item duration limit: Force each asset's playing time is same as Each Item Duration time. When this is checked, you will need to select how you want to handle when an item's duration is less than "Each item duration":
  + Move to next: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will move to next
  + Repeat: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will repeat the same asset until the "Each item duration" is over.
