## Adding Your Excel Spreadsheet as a DataSource

There are two different methods to adding Excel Spreadsheet to your DataSources:

|  |
| --- |
| **IMPORTANT NOTE** |
| OptiSync does not currently (as of 1/15/2025) support Excel's date formatting. In order for dates to properly display, they will need to be redone in TEXT format, or use a formula (like =TEXT(A1, "mm/dd/yy")) to convert them. |

#### **Method 1: Through Designer**

* On the Files/Assets page, select **Designer** from the Apps
* Select **DataSource** on the side menu, then **Add DataSource**
* Click **Microsoft 365 Excel**
* Grant access to your Microsoft 365 Excel by **signing in** when prompted
* Find and select your Excel spreadsheet from the Microsoft pop-up window
  + If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, select the one you want to import from the drop-down menu
* Click **Import Data**
* Double check your table, select **Update**
* **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
* Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
* Click **Done**

**Method 2: Through Account Settings**

* In our portal, select your account name, then **More**, then **DataSources**
* Click **Microsoft 365 Excel**
* Grant access to your Microsoft 365 Excel by **signing in** when prompted
* Find and select your Excel spreadsheet from the Microsoft pop-up window
  + If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, select the one you want to import from the drop-down menu
* Click **Import Data**
* Double check your table, select **Update**
* **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
* Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
* Click **Done**

**Synchronization**

* **Only once import:** This option imports the data only once when you add the DataSource. After the initial import, the data will not be updated automatically.
* **Periodic direct access:** This option regularly fetches the latest data directly from the device through your gateway, providing "live access" to the data and ensuring you have the most up-to-date information available directly from the device.
  + *This is better for more consistent update intervals, but could cause performance issues.*
* **Periodic background sync:** This option periodically syncs data to your server in the background at regular intervals, reducing the need for direct queries to the device.

**Update Interval**

The duration of time between updates if you chose "Periodic direct access" or "Periodic background sync"

* None *(Your Datasource will import with the newest data available, but will not continuously update afterward. You will have to force refresh data for new updates.)*
* 30 minutes
* 1 hour
* 8 hours

### Limitations

* OptiSync does not support special characters (i.e. anything outside the scope of an English-language keyboard). This will cause the system data to read as blank, and it will not show.
* Row 1 of your Spreadsheet will register as a Header, and must be regular text to support features like Excel Function outputs. A function cannot exist in Row 1 of a spreadsheet.
