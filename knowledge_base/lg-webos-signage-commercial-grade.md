#### **Batch installation from the server URL with settings from a USB drive:**

Instead of typing in the URL and change settings for reach device, you can create USB drive to re-use it on many screens.

```
{  
“serverIp” : “0.0.0.0”,  
“serverPort” : 0,  
“secureConnection” : false,  
“fqdnMode” : true,  
“fqdnAddr” : “https://links.optisigns.com/lg”,  
“appLaunchMode” : “local”,  
“appType” : “ipk”  
}
```

2) Copy this file into the root of the USB drive

4) Once the installation finish, restart the TV and OptiSigns app will AutoStart.
