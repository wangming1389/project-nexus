Managing large numbers of devices can seem overwhelming. That's why we've introduced the **Devices** tab, where you can easily organize and troubleshoot your devices from a single location.

This tab and interface is largely designed for IT personnel and becomes available to OptiSigns Pro Plus plan subscribers once they've set up and registered 5 screens or more on OptiSigns.

## Provisioning Templates and Enterprise WiFi

On the bottom section of the left sidebar are the **Provisioning Templates** and **Wi-Fi & 802.1x** sections.

#### Provisioning Templates

If running a large deployment of digital signs, mass provisioning will save a lot of time and effort. It is supported on the OptiStick, Pro Player, ProMax Player, Android OS devices, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi, ChromeOS, or AppleTV.

Before provisioning can occur, you must meet a few prerequisites:

* The device needs to support using a USB drive or SD card. Or there is a way you can push the configuration file to a specific location in the OS.
* The user using the OS has the privilege to run the installation and access the USB drive or SD card.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53507207858707)

Create a new provisioning template by clicking the **Create templates** button.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53507207859091)

* **Template Name -** Name of your template, this is for you to distinguish it when you have multiple provisioning templates.
* **Device Name Prefix -** This is used to generate the device name during provisioning.
* **Device Name Suffix -** This is used to generate the device name during provisioning, the default setting will add timestamps as a suffix.
* **Folder -** The folder you want to have the provisioned devices to be created.
* **Network -** Select from the stored WiFi, which needs to be created first in the Wi-Fi & 802.1X section.
* **Time Zone -** Specify the time zone of the device.
* **Tags -** Specify the tags you want to associate with the devices.
* **Initial Default Content Type -** Used to set the initial content on the device after provisioning.
* **Orientation -** Set the orientation, landscape is the default.
* **Sync Play -** Used to set the turn on/off of the sync play feature. For more details on the Sync Play feature, please click [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412065189267-Synchronized-playback-Sync-Play-feature).
* **Location -** Set the location of the device.

Once the template is created, it will be available under the list of provisioning templates. Download the config file for use during deployment. The configuration file's name is "provisioning-template-<Your Template Name>.cfg"

#### Wi-Fi & 802.1X

Here, you can configure Wi-Fi networks to quickly assign them to your devices or fleets.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53507223300883)

To do this, click **Add Network**.

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/53507223301651)

Here, put in your Wi-Fi information. These networks can then be pre-assigned to new devices you add, or plan to add, and assigned as tags to Fleets.
