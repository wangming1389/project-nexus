Otherwise, let's dive in.

## **1) Create and prepare your Excel**

First, we need to make sure your spreadsheet will fit on a single page. To do this, go to the **Page Layout**tab, then locate the **Scale to Fit**area. Here, for the **Width**, keep it to **1 page**, then set **Height**to **however large your spreadsheet is**.

Then upload your Excel file to your Microsoft OneDrive. If you're using the Web version of Excel, you can skip this step.

### Why does using Excel require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.
