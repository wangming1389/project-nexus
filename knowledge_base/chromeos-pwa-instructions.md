Chrome boxes are common for large-scale digital signage deployment as there are industrial-grade chrome boxes such as [AOpen Commercial Chromebox](https://amzn.to/33Zcu22) or [ASUS Chromebit](https://amzn.to/2FS8FDP).

Chrome devices are very stable, and provide excellent performance, they can also be managed by Google Chrome Device Management which will simplify your large-scale deployment, ensure enterprise security, and reduce device management overhead. You can learn more about Google's Chrome Device Management [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/1289314?hl=en#:~:text=Enforce%20policies%20and%20manage%20apps&text=You%20can%20make%20Wi%2DFi,Manage%20policies%20for%20Chrome%20devices.).

Displaying OptiSigns on a ChromeOS device consists of these broad steps:

1. Adding OptiSigns Player to your Google Admin account
2. Adding the OptiSigns Player app as an extension
3. Mass Provisioning devices (optional)
4. Pushing Content to Your ChromeOS Device

## Mass Provisioning on ChromeOS Devices (optional)

Mass provisioning requires two steps:

1. Creating a mass provisioning template on the OptiSigns Portal
2. Adding the JSON of that template into your Policy for Extensions area in Google Admin

Let's do it.

### Creating a Mass Provisioning Template on OptiSigns

To create a provisioning template, go to the OptiSigns portal and go to the **Username** → **More** → **Provisioning Templates**.

![provisioning templates](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/50218184695315)

Hit **Create New Provisioning Template:**

![optisigns create provisioning template](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49041868805267)

You'll be asked to set up the template.

![provisioning template creation window](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280054419)

* **Template Name**: Name of your template, this is for you to distinguish it when you have multiple provisioning templates.
* **Device Name Prefix**: This is used to generate the device name during provisioning.
* **Device Name Suffix**: This is used to generate the device name during provisioning, the default setting will add timestamps as a suffix.
* **Folder**: The folder you want to have the provisioned devices to be created.
* **WIFI**: Select from the stored WIFI, need to be created first. Only required if you want to setup WIFI during provisioning. WIFI setup is normally not needed for ChromeOS deployment. Because the deployment will be managed through Chrome Device Management.
* **Time Zone**: Specify the time zone of the device.
* **Tags**: Specify the tags you want to associate to the devices.
* **Initial Default Content Type**: Used to set the initial content on the device after provisioning.
* **Orientation**: Set the orientation, landscape is the default.
* **Sync Play**: Used to set the turn on/off of the sync play feature. For more details of Sync Play feature, please click [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412065189267-Synchronized-playback-Sync-Play-feature).
* **Location**: Set the location of the device.

#### Advanced

![advanced creation window](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280055571)

* **If device already paired**: Provides options for devices which have already been paired in OptiSigns and how to handle that:

![wifi options](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295547411)

Once the template is created, it will be available under the list of provisioning templates. You can download the config file and it will be available for deployment. Click **Download**, then **ChromeOS**.

![adding chromeos to provisioning template](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295552531)

Your configuration file will be "provisionting-template-<Your Template Name>.txt".

This file contains a JSON object. This is what you will need to set up auto-provisioning in the next step.

### Adding to Extension Policy and Applying to OptiSigns Player

Now, go back to [**Google Admin**](http://admin.google.com) and navigate back to the **Apps & Extensions** menu.

Click the **OptiSigns extension** then

![optisigns provisioning id](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039295555347)

Your JSON value will now appear in the field:

![optisigns provisioning json](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/49039280067219)

Save it!

Now your ChromeOS devices are provisioned. Follow our [**Getting Started**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/18823504383891-OptiSigns-Getting-Started-Guide)guide to pair the device in OptiSigns, upload content, then get your displays working!

## Adding OptiSigns Player to a Private Account

If you don't have a Google Admin account, you can still get the OptiSigns PWA to work on ChromeOS devices. Just follow these steps.

First, go to the Chrome Web Store and **Search extensions and themes:**
