## Frequently Asked Questions About Schedules

**What if there is a one-time schedule overlapping a recurring schedule?**

The one-time schedule will take priority.

**Example:**

* Recurring schedule A (9 AM - 5 PM daily) overlaps with a one-time schedule B (10 AM - 11 AM) today.

**Playback Order:**

* 9 AM - 10 AM: Recurring schedule A
* 10 AM - 11 AM: Single schedule B
* 11 AM - 5 PM: Recurring schedule A resumes

**What if there are two recurring schedules overlapping?**

The most recently created/ updated schedule will take priority.

**What happens when there's nothing scheduled?**

If there is no scheduled content, the screen will display a black screen by default. To avoid this, you can set default content. There are two ways to do this:

* **At the Schedule Level:** Edit the specific schedule, click on **Settings**, and select your preferred default content (None, Account Default, Asset, or Playlist).
