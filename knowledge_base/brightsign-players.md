# BrightSign Players
        BrightSign is the leader in commercial grade digital signage players, which is known for its reliability. OptiSigns provides full support on BrightSign player, however we do recommend using the HD, XD, and XT product lines for better performance.

It is very easy to setup OptiSigns on BrightSign players. There are 2 ways you can set it up. You can set it up in standalone mode, or you can set it up on BSN.cloud.

## Option 1: Setup with BSN.cloud

**1) Download BrightAuthor**

The latest BrightAuthor can be downloaded [here](https://www.brightsign.biz/digital-signage-products/software/brightauthor).

**2) Logon to your BSN.cloud account and select device setup**

**5) Insert the SD card to the player and let it finish the setup**

The BrightSign player will read the setup files and complete the setup automatically. It will take a few minutes and may reboot a few times.

Once the setup process is complete, you will see OptiSigns player running on your screen with the pairing code showing up on the screen.

Please make sure your BrightSign player is connected to the internet.

The autorun.zip file should be placed in the root of your SD card. The SD card needs to be formatted to **FAT32**. NTFS format does not work for this setup

## Updating BrightSign Software

If you have further issues running OptiSigns, it's possible you have an outdated version of the BrightSign software. We recommend updating it.

The latest version of BrightSign software can be found [here](https://www.brightsign.biz/resources/software-downloads/).

## How to Update the BrightSign Registry to Use Newer Versions of Chromium

A common issue we find is that BrightSign may need a registry update in order to display newer versions of Chromium. This is a particular issue with displaying PowerBI.

To do this, open up BrightAuthor:connected and navigate to **Admin:**

Now you'll need to obtain the IP of your BrightSign player. Input the IP address into your browser (your device must be on the same network as the BrightSign player). If you've done things correctly, you will enter the player config menu.

Once there, navigate to **Registry**:

From this

Next, input the following command:

```
registry write html widget_type chromium110
```

When you hit submit, you'll see this:

This will allow your BrightSign player to use the latest versions of Chromium.
