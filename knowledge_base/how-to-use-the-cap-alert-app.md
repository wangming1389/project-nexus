Some Emergency Alert Systems or Emergency Mass Notification Systems (like Everbridge, RAVE. and Alertus) can push CAP (Common Alerting Protocol) and Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) messages to the targets including digital signage when there is an emergency. You can integrate with these systems using the CAP Alert app with OptiSigns.

Using OptiSigns' CAP Alert app, you can generate a webhook and integrate it with the Emergency Alert System. When there is an emergency, the emergency alert system will call the webhook to send the CAP/IPAWS message and trigger the CAP alert app. The CAP/IPAWS alert will take over the target screens and display the emergency message. The screen will resume and play the original content when the emergency is over.

### Advanced Settings

Click **Advanced** to expand the field and provide a slate of additional options:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48757530712979)

* **Enable Lifecycle Handling** - When checked, it allows handling of CAP message lifecycle events including Update, Cancel, and All Clear messages. It does this by checking the <identifier> field. **This option is only applied when "Post to Webhook" is set as the Content Type**. It also enables the below options:

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48786708018707)

* **Handle All Clear** - When enabled, if the alert system sends an "All Clear" message, a brief "all clear" notice will display on all screens for 60 seconds by default. Once this time has passed, content will resume as normal.

|  |
| --- |
| **MORE ABOUT ALL CLEAR** |
| OptiSigns handles All Clear messages in this way:   1. First, it finds the <responseType> in the message:  `<responseType>AllClear</responseType>` 2. Then, it checks the <expires>:  `<expires>2027-01-31T11:23:46-05:00</expires>` 3. If AllClear is noted in the response type, it will display the message **until the designated expires time**. If no time is sent, it will default to 60 seconds. |

* **Handle Update -** When enabled, the app will automatically refresh screens with additional information on the emergency alerts as updates become available.
* **Handle Cancel** - When enabled, the app looks for a "Cancel" message referencing a previous alert. If detected, the emergency alert is immediately removed from your screens and normal content resumes.
* **Item Duration** - How long each individual item in the CAP Alert feed will display.
* **Title Tag** - Message title from the CAP/IPAWS message/RSS feed. Default is <headline> - you can change if your feed is different
* **Description Tag** - Message content from the CAP/IPAWS message/RSS feed, default is <description> - you can change if your feed is different
* **Location (Screen Tags)** - If you can match the screen tags with your location passed from the CAP/IPAWS message/RSS feed - you can use it to control the selection of the target screens. By default, it maps to the "areaDesc" attribute from the CAP alert.

|  |
| --- |
| **IMPORTANT** |
| A common issue we find is the screen displays a "No Content Available" message after users push out the CAP alert using "aeraDesc" an attribute. The solution: if you are not intending to use screen tags to map to location, try changing the Location value from "areaDesc" to any other value, like "areaDesc2". |

![](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/48757514534803)

* **Severity, Urgency, Certainty** - Standard attributes of CAP / IPAWS messages, these options allow you to control the filter of the messages. By default, the app will be triggered on all values. However, you can set these similar to tags - this will filter out anything that does not include these tags.
* **Filter content containing** - Allows content to be filtered based on specific words in the title or description. I.E: "fire", so if any title or description contains the word "fire" (non-case insensitive), the app will trigger the screen takeover.
* **Exclude title containing** - Filter only applying to the title. You can hide all the old feeds by filtering with specific words in the title. I.E: “All Clear”, so after the emergency is gone, all the feeds before this title will be hidden, then the screen will revert to the original content or just display the new content after that.
* **Category, Code, Event Code** - Additional filters allowing you to include or exclude certain event categories, codes, or event codes.

When finished, click **Save**.

## How to Test Your CAP Alert

After Saving, the app will generate a Webhook URL automatically. When this Webhook is called, it will perform the functions designated in your CAP Alert app. If you share the Webhook URL with your Emergency Alert System, it will be able to trigger this Webhook during an emergency and take over the screens.

To test your CAP alert integration, we recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to post a CAP/IPAWS message to the Webhook.

First, download or log in to Postman. Once there, navigate to **Home → Send an API request → New Request:**

**![postman with arrows pointing toward Home tab and New Request button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695686427411)**

Once here, change the request type to **POST:**

![postman demonstration of how to select POST option](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695686435475)

Input the Webhook URL for your CAP Alert next.

Now, navigate to the **Body** tab. Here, you can send data two ways: **URL encoded** or as a **raw XML file**. Here we will assume you are sending your data as raw XML, as this is the most common format we see from Emergency Alert Services.

CAP/IPAWS Alerts are generally delivered via an external Emergency Alert System, which are saved as **.xml** or **.txt** files. These are broadcast via the [Common Alerting Protocol Version 1.2](https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html). To push an XML file, click the **raw → Dropdown →** select **XML**.

**![postman step by step on selecting XML format](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695686448403)**

Then, copy and paste the following piece of test code into the field:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<alert xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:emergency:cap:1.2">
    <identifier>ALERTUS_2317_67_20230131_162046</identifier>
    <sender>Tester</sender>
    <sent>2023-01-31T11:20:47-05:00</sent>
    <status>Actual</status>
    <msgType>Alert</msgType>
    <source>Alertus eEAS Server</source>
    <scope>Public</scope>
    <addresses>ALL</addresses>
    <code>IPAWSv1.0</code>
    <info>
        <language>en-US</language>
        <category>Safety</category>
        <event>TEST Event Name Override</event>
        <responseType>None</responseType>
        <urgency>Immediate</urgency>
        <severity>Severe</severity>
        <certainty>Observed</certainty>
        <eventCode>
            <valueName>SAME</valueName>
            <value>LAE</value>
        </eventCode>
        <effective>2023-01-31T11:20:47-05:00</effective>
        <onset>2023-01-31T11:20:47-05:00</onset>
        <expires>2023-01-31T11:23:46-05:00</expires>
        <headline>Test286</headline>
        <description>This is a Test of the Alertus Emergency Notification System. NO ACTION is Needed. In a real emergency, this system will be used to provide emergency information and protective actions. Please return to your normal activities.</description>
        <area>
            <areaDesc1>Tag1</areaDesc1>
            <geocode>
                <valueName>SAME</valueName>
                <value>000000</value>
            </geocode>
        </area>
        <parameter> 
            <valueName>duration</valueName> 
            <value>30</value> 
        </parameter> 
    </info>
</alert>
```

It will look something like this:

![postman xml input example](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695707719699)

You can set the duration of the CAP/IPAWS alert message as well. In raw XML format, you can pass the duration value through a system parameter in your CAP alert message.

Now, to test the request, hit **Send**. A piece of text should appear on the console below. If the test was successful, it should give a **200 OK code** and say "status": "success":

![postman showing code layout under raw data tab](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695707725715)

And this message (assuming all the defaults were kept in the CAP Alert app) will appear on your screen:

![test message for the CAP alert system](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33695707733779)

#### Creating a Test Request in urlEncoded Format

Using urlEncoded format, the duration can be passed as URL parameter together with data.

![example in postman of urlencoded format](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/33696696479251)

The rest of the test can be performed identically.
